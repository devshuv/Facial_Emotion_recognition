# Facial_Emotion_recognition

This project involves image loading and preprocessing, face detection using Haar Cascades, applying transfer learning with a MobileNetV2 model for classification, and making predictions on new images.
This project focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 7 categories using augmented image data and saving the trained model.

After that using pre-trained deep learning model and OpenCV this project performs real-time face emotion recognition.
